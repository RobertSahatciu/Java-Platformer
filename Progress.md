# Daily Progress Report - Java Game Project

**Date:** 16/01/2025
## Tasks Completed

### Game Loop Implementation
- Updated the `Game` class to implement the `Runnable` interface and added a robust game loop to manage frame updates.
- Introduced a constant `FPS_SET` to control the frame rate, targeting 120 frames per second.
- Implemented the `run` method to calculate and display frames per second (FPS) in the console.

## Challenges Faced
- The game loop took significant time to implement, leading to a delay of about one week in the overall project timeline.
- Debugging and optimizing the loop to ensure smooth and consistent frame rates were particularly time-consuming.

## Solutions Implemented
- After multiple iterations, the game loop was successfully set up to handle frame updates efficiently.
- Used a test rectangle to verify the loop's functionality, confirming smooth rendering and updating.

## Future Plans
- Continue building on the game loop to handle more complex game logic and interactions.
- Refocus efforts to make up for lost time by prioritizing essential features.
