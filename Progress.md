# Daily Progress Report - Java Game Project

**Date:** 17/01/2025

## Objective
Enhance keyboard input handling and player animations in the game.

## Tasks Completed

- Implemented `KeyboardInputs` class for handling directional movement (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys).
- Updated `GamePanel` to respond to key actions, improving player control.
- Integrated sprite animations using a 2D `BufferedImage` array.
- Developed methods to manage animation states (`IDLE`, `RUNNING`, etc.) and transitions.
- Refined the game loop to ensure smooth frame updates and responsive animations.
- Centralized player actions and directions in `Constants` for streamlined management.

## Challenges
- Synchronizing inputs with animations and maintaining smooth gameplay.
- Efficiently handling sprite sheet loading and animations.

## Future Plans
- Optimize the game loop and expand player actions with new animations.
- Implement collision detection and interactive elements.
